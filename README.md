# discord-bot-amira
A discord bot called Amira. Used on the Carrera Chronicles server for RPG things like rolling dice and calculating success points and failures.

This project is still in progress and I plan on adding more features like storing character XP, changing character's name color etc.
## Current commands:
* `!ping` - replies with pong! 
* `!skyrim` - replies with "belongs to the Nords!"
* `!roll 5` - rolles a d10 die 5 times. (You can change 5 to the desired die roll amount for each roll.) Displays roll outcome in ascending order. Also calculates success points and critical failures
